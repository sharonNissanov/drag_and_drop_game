# Live preview: https://drag-and-drop-game.herokuapp.com/
## ❗ ❗ ❗ This is not an ordinary game ❗ ❗ ❗
The game starts with 0 points.  
The goal is to score 10 points in 3 minutes by dragging the clothes/shoes to the closet.

Every **8** seconds a garment appears on the screen (such as a dress, shirt, etc.)\
And every **20-30** seconds a pair of shoes appears on the screen.\
Both appear for exactly 8 seconds,\
and only **4** seconds after they appear they can be dragged.

💁 So, how does it work? 💁

✴ If you dragged a garment and there is no pair of shoes on the screen: **+1**. \
✴ If you dragged a pair of shoes on the screen: **+2**.\
✴ If you didn't drag the garment: **-1**.\
✴ If you didn't drag the pair of shoes: **-2**.\
✴ If you dragged a garment and there is a pair of shoes on the screen: **-2**. 

Enjoy 😊
